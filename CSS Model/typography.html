            <h2>The Power of Good Typography</h2>
            <p>
                <mark>Typography</mark> is not just about choosing beautiful fonts—it’s about creating a <strong>visual rhythm</strong> that guides the reader’s eye and improves understanding. 
                Proper <em>text styling</em> can transform a simple paragraph into a delightful reading experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Good typography involves balance—between font <strong>weight</strong>, <em>size</em>, spacing, and contrast. 
                Designers use principles like <mark>line-height</mark> and <mark>letter-spacing</mark> to ensure readability and harmony across a page. 
                Whether it’s a headline shouting for attention or a calm, flowing paragraph, each has a role in storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember: clear typography enhances comprehension, accessibility, and overall design quality. 
                Every letter contributes to the <em>tone</em> of your message, and thoughtful styling makes words truly come alive.
